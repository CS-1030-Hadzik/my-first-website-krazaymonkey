# About Me

  Hi! My name is Tiffany and I'm a student at Weber State University, studying 
  Computer Science. I've created this website as an assignment for a class and 
  also to showcase some of my skills. Thank you to Scott Hadzik for creating the
  base code and assignment.

## My First Website

  The below link is a website I created through Weebly.com while in High School to showcase different things about my time in school.

I went to The Academy for Math, Engineering, & Science (AMES) in Salt Lake City, UT. AMES is an early-collge high school that partners with the University of Utah.

*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```
